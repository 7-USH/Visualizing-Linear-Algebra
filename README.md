## ðŸ“„ Description
> Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately. Manim relies on Pythonâ€™s simplicity to generate animations programmatically, making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look at the Example Gallery for some inspiration on how to create beautiful images and videos with Manim.



## ðŸ‘¨ Eigen Faces
 - An eigenface is the name given to a set of eigenvectorsÂ when used in the computer vision problem of humanÂ face recognition.Â 
 
 - This can be done by determining the variance of faces in a collection of face images and use those variances to encode and decode a face in a machine learning way without the full information reducing computation and space complexity.

 - The approach of using eigenfaces forÂ recognitionÂ was developed by Sirovich and Kirby and used by Matthew TurkÂ and Alex PentlandÂ in face classification.

- The following images shows are example of Eigen faces
